 *
 * The Injector class acts as a facade around the core dependency injection
 * methods of the DotApp framework, making it easier to configure and manage
 * dependencies in a centralized manner.

/*
    Injector Class Usage:

    The Injector class is essential for managing dependencies within the DotApp framework.
    It provides methods for registering singleton and bind resolvers, allowing for
    flexible dependency injection configurations.

    Example:
    - Register a singleton dependency:
      `Injector::singleton(DotApp::class, function() {return $this;});`
    - Bind a dependency:
      `Injector::bind(Response::class, function() {return new Response(DotApp::dotApp()->request);});`
